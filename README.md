# Capstone Project

## Overview

This repository contains the capstone project for my data science course. The project showcases my skills and knowledge in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Project Description

The capstone project involves analyzing a dataset to uncover insights and build predictive models. The main tasks include:

1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building and evaluation
5. Data visualization

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed data files
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and model building steps
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training
- `reports/`: Generated reports and visualizations
- `README.md`: Overview and instructions for the project

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/capstone-project.git
    ```
## Usage

To start the analysis, open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory. Each notebook is numbered in the order it should be executed.

## Results

The project results include insights from the data, feature importance, and the performance of the predictive models. Detailed visualizations and reports can be found in the `reports/` directory.
